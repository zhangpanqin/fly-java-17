     * This is the example how would one use the GraphLayout differences to
     * figure out the object graph changes.
     *
     * Here, we have the ConcurrentHashMap, and three measurements:
     *   1) The initial CHM that has no backing storage;
     *   2) After adding the first KV pair, when both KV pair is allocated,
     *      and the backing storage is allocated;
     *   3) After adding the second KV pair.
     *
     * An API for subtracting the GraphLayouts helps to show the difference
     * between the snapshots. Note that differences are based on object
     * addresses, so if GC moves under our feet, the difference is unreliable.
     * It is a good idea to keep the allocations at minimum between the snapshots.
